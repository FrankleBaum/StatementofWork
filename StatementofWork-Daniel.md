# GUI for Student Test Taking 

## Purpose

Client <client_name> of Wichita State University, Wichita, KS, is seeking assistance from provider Daniel Rosendale, an independent contractor, in developing a GUI interface to assist in test taking by students. The purpose of the package is to provide an environment in which the student may have a randomized set of querstions pulled in from a test bank in order to create a unique test set for each student.

## Scope of Work

Code will be appended to the GitHub project (\<linkToGithub>), in the form of a pull request from a separate branch. Provider will transfer any documentation created, source code, and any additional documents that might be useful in additional development.
Deliverables will be transferred to the client before the March 20th. If problems in development arise, extension can be discussed and agreed upon between the client and the provider in good will.

## Deliverables

A `testGenerator` class used to pull questions from a test bank and present the randomized questions in a GUI format to the student test taker. This will utilize the following functionality to create this GUI:
- CSV File: `testBank` â€“ A set of questions loaded in by the instructor prior to the test date.
- Student GUI Interface: A GUI interacted with by the student containing
    - Buttons: Interactive radio buttons to allow for selection of multiple choice answers
    - Text Box: This will allow for student to enter short answer or fill-in-the-blank questions
- Any additional helper functions will be available to call as a public function.

## Timeline

Updates are expected twice each week during Tuesday and Thursday meeting times. Timeline of events are expected to be:
- **Thursday Mar 2nd**: Finalize preparations for project startup. Determine what Project will look like with <client_name>
- **Tuesday Mar 7th**: TKinter research done and project outline started.
- **Thursday Mar 9th**: Frames, buttons, and text box have been coded, CSV input has been accounted for. 
- **Tuesday Mar 14th**: Fixes and testing start here.
- **Thursday Mar 16th**: General implementation finished, ready to submit a pull request to github repository.

## Compensation

<client_name> has agreed to a good grade should wor be completed, in scope, in a timely manner and is in working order. A written letter of recommendation is still currently being negotiated pending desired result.
